## ibuttonr: Functions for cleaning and loading ibutton data into R
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aammd/ibuttonr.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aammd/ibuttonr)

ibuttons are common tools for measuring temperature over time. But, they're also slightly error-prone, and the data requires just a touch of cleaning. These convenience functions automate the reading of ibutton data and perform some elementary error checking.
